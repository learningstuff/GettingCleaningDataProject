# Getting and Cleaning Data: Course Project

This repo contains two files related to this course project:
1. An R script file that produces a tidy dataset, according to project specifications (run_analysis.R).
2. A codebook that outlines details on the data source, data cleaning procedures, and the contents of the dataset (CodeBook.md).

Before running the R script:
* Make sure the R package "reshape2" is installed.
* On lines 9-11, type in the local directory locations for the folder containing the source datasets as provided by the assignment, the folder location for the test data, and the folder location for the training data.

Running the R script will produce a .txt data file saved in the main directory, containing the source datasets as provided by the assignment.
